# Awesome Continuous AI

**[Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/) is any use of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform.** The term aligns with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.
